UNIT lakebase_scaffold (wave 0, serial, width 1). Stand up the Lakebase target schema and load the reference tables.
1. On Lakebase branch mig-20260927-w0 create schema `billing` (idempotent) and typed DDL for CODES, PLANS, TENANTS,
   USAGE_EVENTS exactly as .migration/units/lakebase_scaffold/mapping_spec.json declares (PKs from the Oracle
   dictionary .migration/inventory/oracle_dictionary_20260927.json). DDL lives in the repo under
   databricks/mig_20260927/lakebase/00_scaffold.sql plus a small idempotent apply script.
2. Load those four tables from Oracle via the session bridge (python-oracledb read, psycopg COPY), whole tables,
   `ns::` prefixed demo tenants included. Touch no other billing table; wave 1 units own theirs.
3. Recon: dbx-recon run --family oracle --mode live --depth full ... PASS on all four objects. Also run
   dbx-recon fixture-shape against the fixture copy and dbx-recon type-map-audit on the mapping spec.
4. Gates you must satisfy: w0-structural (schema + tables exist with the declared types and PKs),
   w0-reference-parity (row_parity, depth full, PASS), w0-fixture-shape (fixture column shape equals the Oracle
   dictionary; fixture-shape exit 0).
Write targets: ow_tp.billing.codes, ow_tp.billing.plans, ow_tp.billing.tenants, ow_tp.billing.usage_events
(Lakebase branch mig-20260927-w0 only). Deploy objects: none.
